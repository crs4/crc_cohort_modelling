# crc_cohort_modelling

This repository contains the semantic model, expressed in openEHR, for the clinical data included in the Colorectal Cancer Cohort (CRC-Cohort) acquired by BBMRI-ERIC.
The modelling has been started within the EOSC-Life WP1 Demonstrator “Cloudification of BBMRI-ERIC CRC-Cohort and its Digital Pathology Imaging” (APPID 1228), which had among its objectives 
the improvement of the CRC-Cohort dataset.

## What's the CRC-Cohort?

The CRC-Cohort is a collection of clinical data and digital high-resolution
digital pathology images pertaining to tumor cases.  The collection has been
assembled from a number of participating biobanks and other partners through the
[ADOPT BBMRI-ERIC](https://www.bbmri-eric.eu/scientific-collaboration/adopt-bbmri-eric/) project(H2020-INFRADEV-3-2015).

Researchers interested in using the data for science can [apply for
access](https://www.bbmri-eric.eu/services/access-policies/).
